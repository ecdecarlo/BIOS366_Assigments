      "In one possible random effects model we assume the true effect (on a log-odds scale) $d_i$ in a trial $i$\n",
      "is drawn from some population distribution. Let $r^C_i$ denote number of events in the control group in trial $i$, and $r^T_i$ denote events under active treatment in trial $i$. Our model is:\n",
